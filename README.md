## 🙌 Contributing

Any person who wants to contribute to the initiative is welcome! Please read
[Contributing Guidelines][].

## 🏛 Governance

This initiative adopts the general Node.js [Code of Conduct][], as well as its
own [Contributing Guidelines][].

### Team

The Website Working Group is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the website.

The content of the website comes from a variety of working groups (Evangelism, Core, i18n, etc). The Website WG defers to these WGs on matters of content and routinely adds collaborators from these working groups as they add and improve content on the website. In other words, the Website WG is not an editorial Working Group except when no other Working Group has taken responsibility for a content area.
