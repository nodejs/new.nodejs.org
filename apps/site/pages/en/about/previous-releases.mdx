# Node.js Releases

Major Node.js versions enter _Current_ release status for six months, which gives library authors time to add support for them.
After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported, and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to _Active LTS_ status and are ready for general use.
_LTS_ release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months.
Production applications should only use _Active LTS_ or _Maintenance LTS_ releases.

Full details regarding the Node.js release schedule are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

### Commercial Support

Commercial support for versions past the Maintenance phase is available through our OpenJS Ecosystem Sustainability Program partner [HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com/).

## Official versus Community

The Node.js website offers numerous installation methods that allow Node.js to be installed in a non-interactive manner,
for example, via CLIs, OS package managers (such as `apt`), or Node.js version managers (such as `nvm`).

The Node.js project, in an attempt to popularize and advertise community efforts, has introduced a new Downloads page that lists both Official and Community installation methods, providing more versatility and options for users.
With this change, we introduced the concept of "Official" and "Community" installation methods. In order to be considered "Official", the installation method must meet the following requirements:

| Requirements                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Node.js releases must be available simultaneously upon the official release                                                    |
| Project maintainers have a close relationship with Node.js, including direct communication                                         |
| Installation method downloads the official binaries bundled by the Node.js project                                                 |
| Installation method does **not** build from source when binaries are available, or alter the official binaries provided by Node.js |
