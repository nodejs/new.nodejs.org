## Content vs. Code

The **Website Team** (@nodejs/website) is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the website.

The content of the website comes from a variety of working groups [(Release WG, Ecosystem Security WG and others)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/WORKING_GROUPS.md#current-working-groups).

The Website team defers to these WGs on matters of content and routinely adds collaborators from these working groups as they add and improve content on the website. In other words, the Website team is not an **editorial** team except when no other Working Group has taken responsibility for a content area, meaning we are the default editors for that content.

An example of this policy playing out is new blog posts. Authors such as the Release WG have access to open PRs for new Node.js releases and merge them once their content is ready. No Website team approvals are needed.
