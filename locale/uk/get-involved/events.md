          <p>Thanks to the brilliant work of Ryan Dahl, we have node.js, a beautiful and elegant server-side framework built on top of Google's V8 Javascript engine. This opens up a whole new world of possibility for developing web apps, APIs, and lightweight HTTP servers.</p>
          <p>We try to meet each month on the third week. Each month we'll have a group discussion on a particular aspect of NodeJS, using it to build apps and any tools or workflows based on it.</p>
          <p>If you'd like to present, please send a note with your topic. If you have a suggestion for a topic, feel free to submit it.</p>
          <p>We are always looking for spaces to use for the meetups. If you'd like to offer a space for us to use, please reach out to us.</p>

          <p><b>Other channels</b></p>
          <p>We have a Slack and thriving <b>WhatsApp</b> channel/groups:</p>
          <p><span><b>Slack:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/slack-nbi-js">http://bit.ly/slack-nbi-js</a> (self-invite)</span></p>
          <p><span><b>WhatsApp:</b> get in touch with me (email and twitter handle at the bottom)</span></p>
          <p> <br><b>Introduction</b></p>
          <p><b>First of all</b>, head over to&nbsp;<a href="http://trippa.firebaseapp.com">Trippa</a>, a speed typing testing application, and check/test it out. When satisfied with what you see, head over to it's repo --&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/kn9ts/trippa">http://github.com/kn9ts/trippa</a>, study the files and file structure while at it. Then check out the project (link at the top of the repo).</p>
          <p><span>It was done in </span><b>3 days</b><span>. Is this possible? </span><b>Yes. How?</b><span>Using:</span></p>
          <p><b>- JavaScript Framework</b></p>
          <p><b>- LESS, a CSS preprocessor</b></p>
          <p><b>- JADE, a HTML5/Node.js templating engine</b></p>
          <p><b>- Bower &amp; NPM for efficient package management</b></p>
          <p><b>- Firebase, a cloud push service, database and static server deployment</b></p>
          <p><b>- Gulp.js, a task automation tool</b></p>
          <p><b>- Git &amp; Github for version control and repo hosting respectively</b></p>
          <p><b>- Jshint, a linting tool that automates syntax errors detection and reporting</b></p>
          <p><b>- Static file handling</b></p>
          <p>Now it's harder to believe it was done in 3 days. Since it just seems I've cooked up all the above.</p>
          <p><span>If all the mentioned above were like <b>"何とか何とか何とか..."</b> to you, then you have all the reasons to join this community and be present in all meet-ups and understand how we are able to build complex applications MVPs in mere days or hours. And find out what the "fudge" all the above are.</span> <br></p>
          <p>We look forward to hearing from you, and to seeing you at an upcoming event. Get in touch at <b>eugenemutai@gmail.com</b>&nbsp;or holla at me on <b>twitter: @kn9ts</b> <br></p>

          <p>Instead of simply USING an existing app framework like Backbone, Durandal, express, etc, this is a meetup group for people interested in MAKING application frameworks.</p>
          <p>So if you're developing a new application framework of your own then this is the place to come discuss it, present it, and generally ideate on it with other people genuinely interested in application architecture.</p>
          <p>We discuss, collaborate on, and generally thrash about frameworks both our own as well as the popular ones out there in the open. And we intend to open up the members to each other's styles and strengths and come out with multiple frameworks implemented in open collaboration.</p>
          <p>See you here some time with your thinking hat on :)</p>

          <p><span>CODE OF CONDUCT</span></p>
          <p>If we find someone abusing or disrespecting the organizers, speakers or audience. We hold the right to ask that person to leave the workshop &amp; community. We won't think once before blocking that person.&nbsp;</p>

Please remember to bring your laptop, Arduino, a grab bag of components and ideas. Broken toys, Raspberry Pis, and circuit bent synths also encouraged.</p>

          <p>The Architectural Monolith’s days are numbered. As companies are becoming more and more agile, and see how they can now adapt in order to innovate and compete faster than their competition, software development teams are being forced to maintain and evolve large, monolithic applications at a pace of change that those architectures were never meant to withstand, let alone embrace!</p>
          <p>Microservices are a new approach to architecting applications. They are simple, single-purpose, lightweight architectural components that enable you to deliver software faster. The microservice architectural approach also aims to lead to software that thrives on change while at the same time being secure, performant, and stable.</p>
          <p>This meet up is for people interested in architecting, designing, deploying and maintaining micro service based software architectures.</p>

          <p>This is a group for <b>anyone</b> interested in <b>Node.js</b>. We will meet to <b>talk</b>, <b>hack</b> and <b>learn</b> with and from each other. This is an open group, everyone is invited to <b>propose</b> talks and hands-on ideas. We all are learners in some way, don't be shy. To give you a hint, you could talk about:</p>
          <p>• this one library, that changed your life or just helped you out. <br> </p>
          <p>• how do you use Node? <br> </p>
          <p>• best practices in development and operations <br> </p>
          <p>• integration of Node.js in existing setups <br> </p>
          <p>• interesting hacks or benchmarks <br> </p>
          <p>•&nbsp;name your topic <br> </p>
          <p>The talks can be in english or german, depending on the attenders. However english is preferred in case of conflicts. Usually there should be 1-3 Talks plus enough time for socializing. If <b>you know about someone</b> who definitely should talk at our meetup, <b>put a message</b> and i try to make contact. Or do it yourself.</p>
          <p> <br> </p>
          <p>Also we want to <b>mix the formats</b>, and will do open spaces, panel discussions and other stuff. <br> </p>
          <p> <br> </p>
          <p>We consider this group as an affiliate of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/">HH.js</a> group. If you have some general talks on JavaScript or front-end specific stuff, please <b>consider to talk there</b> (most of us attend there anyway :) ). This being said, if you have a strong argument to talk here instead, we are happy to have you here. <br> </p>
          <p><b>Feedback Channel</b></p>
          <p>we have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/lmbd9rpc">(new) Trello Board</a>, where you can put any kind of feedback, your ideas, wishes and proposals. We have a voting option there as well. Please use this! <br> </p>

          <p>Franken ist reich an Entwicklern, guten Ideen, weltklasse Software und Kreativität. Wir sind uns sicher, dass sich hinter all diesen Talenten auch einige JavaScript-Developer verbergen.</p>
          <p>Viele Großstädte und Metropolregionen organisieren seit einigen Jahren JavaScript Usergroups und Meet-Ups. Franken, insbesondere die Großstädte Nürnberg, Erlangen und Fürth, sollten dem in nichts nachstehen. Daher haben wir es uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, das JavaScript KnowHow der Region zu bündeln und zu verbreiten. Wir möchten uns mit dieser Usergroup aktiv dafür einsetzen, dieses Wissen in der Region zu teilen und andere Entwickler dafür zu begeistern.</p>
          <p>Da eine Usergroup nur mit ihren Mitgliedern wachsen kann, sind wir auf&nbsp;euch&nbsp;angewiesen. Was erwartet ihr von einem JavaScript / Web-Meetup? Welche Themen interessieren euch besonders? Womit wollt/könnt ihr bei der Usergroup beitragen? In welcher Region Frankens würdet ihr das erste Treffen bevorzugen? Erwartet ihr neben entspannter Atmosphäre professionelle Talks?</p>
          <p>Ihr erreicht uns ebenfalls auf Twitter unter <a href="http://twitter.com/FrankenJS">@FrankenJS</a>, per E-Mail:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:servus@frankenjs.org">servus@frankenjs.org</a>, oder über unsere Website&nbsp;<a href="http://frankenjs.org">http://frankenjs.org</a></p>

          <p>I'd like to have a first meetup somewhen between mid to end of October. As soon as some people join the group, we can have a discussion about some topics for a first talk. Surely we can also organise something earlier if there's a demand.<br>

           I assume in the beginning I'll give a short intro to Node.js for people that don't know the ecosystem yet.<br>

          <p>Niekomercyjne spotkania front-endowe typu meetup, organizowane przez społeczność dla społeczności. Zero komercji, czysta wiedza.</p>
          <p>Na każdym meet.js można liczyć na kilka prelekcji na tematy webowo-front-endowe (JS, CSS, HTML etc.). Każda z nich trwa 10-15 minut. Duży nacisk kładziemy na Q&amp;A po danym speechu. Spikerami jesteśmy my sami - developerzy. Tylko od specjalistów można dowiedzieć się najwięcej. Każdy może przemawiać na meet.js - wystarczy się zgłosić! Zabawa i cenne doświadczenie gwarantowane!</p>

          <p>There was a time when someone walked into store, had a chat with the store-owner and asked him which products he would recommend. The store-owner, knowing this person for years, would pull the right thing out of a shelf and turn the visitor into a happy customer. If the store-owner knew his trade really well, he would even anticipate his customers’ wishes and actively suggest something they did not know they needed - yet.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In this sense, personalization has always been a core principle of retail. And in this digital day and age, technical developments such data analysis and specialized APIs can make individualization and proactive personalization even more effective and provide interesting opportunities to merchants. With mobile devices and wearables learning more about their customers’ tastes and preferences, they can build better and more targeted applications and get a headstart against their competition.</p>
          <p>New developments in hard- and software make it possible to reach online customers <br>far beyond their desktop computers and blur the boundaries between online and <br>“real” life. Emerging devices enable new forms of human-machine interaction and <br>redefine the way in which online retail is done. ecomhack.io 2015 is all about <br>mobile technology, emerging devices, keyboard-free interaction, a natural <br>shopping experience as an integral part of our everyday lives and the role of APIs in <br>shaping the future of e-commerce.</p>
          <p>This weekend in Berlin is all about projects with an interesting approach to personalization and fresh ideas that make buying things more individual, more effective - and more fun. </p>

          <p>Web Monday is an informal, non-commercial, and completely community-driven event that aims to connect the people who are shaping the future of the internet. Inspired by the culture of Silicon Valley, it started out in Cologne, Germany in late 2005 in an effort to help spread those sunny California vibes. Anyone involved in web 2.0 or neighboring fields who is interested in learning and sharing with others is most welcome to join. Whether you are a thinker, builder, designer, founder or funder – Web Monday is your chance to present your OSS, your product, your service, your startup, or your next big idea to a growing audience of web aficionados and aficionadas.</p>

          <p>Oxford has a JavaScript meetup, London does, I thought MK needed one. I don't have any firm plans as to what the meetup should be. Initially I think that it would be good to just get some interested people together and meet up somewhere and discuss what people are interested in, what's new and what's exciting. When we build up a bit of momentum, we can try organise a bit more formally and get people to give talks and give people a platform to speak if they'd like. If anyone has other ideas they think would be good, please get in touch, it'd be great to get this meetup going. Hope to see some of you soon! (Sorry about the extra full stop at the end of the group name. It had to be six characters...)</p>
          <p> <br></p>
          <p>We now have a github where you can submit talks and give feedback: <a href="http://www.github.com/mkjs">www.github.com/mkjs</a></p>
          <p>We're aiming for talks of around 20 minutes per slot, with up to 3 slots at an event. We're also going to have some time for shorter "Lightning Talks" of about 5 minutes each, so feel free to submit a shorter talk if you'd like.</p>

          <p>In this group we focus on the server side - Node.js. Thanks to v8, it runs many times faster than PHP, Ruby or Python, and thanks to the event-based design, it is the ultimate back-end for mobile and web applications. It is fast to code and needs less CPU &amp; RAM - speeding up your development and saving you server costs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The group is open to anyone interested. Whether you're wondering why in the world you would want to put JavaScript on a server or want to discuss how async/await is the best thing since sliced bread, let's meet up!</p>

          <p>Os encontros desse meetup irão sempre vir com um senso crítico, questionador das ferramentas adotadas - para que os dizeres acima se tornem realidade e para que todos tenha entendimento do todo que precisamos conhecer para levar uma carreira de Desenvolvedor Web comprometida do inicio ao fim com os resultados.</p>

          <p>A NodeBR é uma comunidade fundada por pessoas com interesse em aprender mais sobre Node.js assim como ajudar outras pessoas que possuem dúvidas nessa plataforma. No momento a comunidade é constituída por estes pontos de acesso principal</p>
          <p>* A lista de e-mails é um grupo no Google onde você pode cadastrar o seu endereço de e-mail para enviar e receber e-mails das outras pessoas cadastradas. Esta lista mostrou-se extremamente eficaz na resolução de dúvidas de pessoas iniciantes no Node.js, assim como também é o ponto de encontro de discussões proveitosas e notícias sobre a plataforma.</p>
          <p>* Nosso canal #nodebr no IRC é uma ferramenta de bate papo em tempo real, onde programadores trocam ideias e tiram dúvidas com outros membros que estão online, a ferramenta é nova e cresce junto com a comunidade. Para quem já possui instalado algum client IRC, nos achará facilmente no canal #nodebr na rede freenode.net, para aqueles que ainda não possuem um, podem acessar o link anterior para abrir o web chat e entrar diretamente no canal.</p>
          <p>* O grupo de Meetup de São Paulo é onde organizamos nossos encontros e marcamos os eventos mensais que trazem informação e novidades sobre o mundo do Node.js.</p>
          <p>* O site oficial da comunidade está em fase de planejamento mas já é uma ferramenta extramente importante na nossa comunidade, visto que ela abrigará as principais ferramentas que a comunidade julga importante, como você pode ver no brainstorming.</p>

          <p><span style="color : #000000"><strong>NebraskaJS</strong></span> <span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : 13px">was founded in fall of 2009 by local front-end heros Jonathan Sharp, Andrew Wirick, and Eli Perelman. It was originally focused solely on jQuery, but later expanded to include other front end technologies.</span></p>
          <p><span style="color : #000000">In 2012, group leadership duties were passed on to Zach Leatherman and the group decided to move away from a jQuery focus toward a more generic JavaScript focus. Nick Nisi</span> joined mid-2013 primarily to get more JavaScript developers to use Vim. In 2014, Blaine Kasten joined to bring NebraskaJS to Lincoln.</p>
          <p><span style="color : #000000">Our goals:</span></p>
          <ul>
          <li><span style="color : #000000"><span>Encourage open source/community contributions by our members. A portion of every meeting is dedicated to small lightning talks on GitHub issues that members in the community have contributed to/closed out (no issue too small!).</span><br>

          </span></li>
          <li><span style="color : #000000"><span><span>Sharing workflow and useful tools. Small coding exercises dedicated to showing how others work can expose useful tips and tricks to separate the wheat from the chaff in development tooling.</span><br>

          </span></span></li>
          <li><span style="color : #000000"><span><span><span>All presentations are recorded and published online, in the hopes that it will improve the quality of presentations and offer nice exposure and incentive to present.</span><br>

          <p><span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : 13px">We seek to bring together the developer and designer community in and around Omaha and cover interesting topics relevant to front end web development. Come join us for an informative event and a great community!</span></p>

We want to foster an environment where it's okay to ask questions and it's okay not to know about certain aspects of the language.

          <p>If you are interested in learning or sharing anything about designing, developing and supporting a great <strong>web</strong> site, service, app or online social network community, this group will not just explore, but we will discuss and possibly build, <strong>together</strong>. &nbsp;This includes Javascript, HTML5, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, mobile web support, CakePHP, WordPress and other content management systems. &nbsp;But it does not stop there.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This group will identify and explore the use of <strong>technologies</strong>, <strong>content</strong>, <strong>media</strong> and <strong>social</strong> elements that goes into supporting a <strong>Web 2.0/3.0</strong>&nbsp;environment. &nbsp;<strong>We won't just talk about these elements, we will use them to help each other build something.</strong>&nbsp; In-depth exploration, discussion, experimentation and implementation of <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, any and all <strong>elements</strong> that support today's web environment and services will be executed. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Meet our new organizers for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-Design-Development-Tech-and-Media-Authority/" target="_blank">DC Web Design Development Tech and Media Authority</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="http://tacticaltechs.com/web-developer-organizers-team.jpg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There's more to a web site than just the front end and various types of engines that do the work, you have to have somewhere to store the data itself right? &nbsp;We will explore and discuss the different database models such as <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>CouchDB</strong> and many others that can be used, depending on the <strong>requirements</strong> of the web project. &nbsp;While we we are at it, let's explore <strong>Cassandra</strong>.</p>
          <p>So we will cover the web tech, content, media and the social elements of a website/service, but there is still more to it. &nbsp;So <strong>web hosting services</strong>, types and features will be identified. &nbsp;Everything from the use of shared hosting plans all the way up to <strong>Amazon Web Service (AWS)</strong> will be explored. &nbsp;Members will be able to make better more informed decisions on hosting service selections based on what we experience together.</p>
          <p>There is a lot involved in developing a website, a service platform, social network or other online environment. &nbsp;You have the content, media, front and back ends of the solution that may leverage many pieces of technology fused together to make everything look great and function well. &nbsp;Some of us don't have the skills, time and/or resources to design, develop and maintain a website. For those members we will identify the best content management system (CMS that meets their needs such s <strong>WordPress</strong> and other popular CMS solutions. &nbsp;We will also explore emerging CMS solutions based on Ruby on Rails such as Locomotive, Radiant and Browser CMS to determine if they are worth the attention and time to implement.</p>
          <p>Big ambitions right, well this is going to be a big group.</p>
          <p>Using methods pioneered by&nbsp;<strong>JumpstartLab</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;Hungry Academy</strong>, we want to grow our own developers, including Ruby on Rails.</p>
          <p>Folks, presentations are great, but this group is about more than that. &nbsp;We are actually going to build developers, build web sites and new types of online services.</p>
          <p>How will we accomplish all of this?</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Presentations</strong>&nbsp;from Ruby on Rails Pros, Javascript, HTML5, WordPress, CakePHP and other evangelists.</li>
          <li><strong>Workshops</strong>&nbsp;(Hands On) introductions to new development tools, coding techniques, plugins, advance features and more</li>
          <li><strong>Study Groups</strong>&nbsp;weekly smaller sessions at different locations to&nbsp;continue using web development toolkits on real world projects or just for fun</li>
          <li><strong>Plugin</strong>&nbsp;development to extend the capabilities &nbsp;of WordPress and other CMS solutions</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;small and large, including conference size events hosted by our&nbsp;<strong>partners</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Talking about web design and development tech and&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;doing anything useful with it is not what this group is about. &nbsp;We expect more and want to turn this into a&nbsp;<strong>real community</strong>&nbsp;of developers of all levels to&nbsp;<strong>learn</strong>,<strong>share</strong>&nbsp;and possibly&nbsp;<strong>collaborate</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>real world projects</strong>.</p>
          <p>If this sound like something interesting that you want to be a part of, join us. &nbsp;If you want to contribute to meetups, become an organizer or even be a moderator at our study halls, just let us know.</p>

          <p><span>We evaluate technologies and methodologies applicable anywhere within the software stack, but always in the context of multi-platform development and architectural impact. Preference is given to standards-oriented browser/web technologies, such as HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, Javascript, etc. and cross-platform tools from Adobe and others. Discussions evaluate the technical merits of a subject and how it plays with other elements in the bigger picture, such as integration, workflow, maintenance and market/marketing considerations.</span></p>
          <p><span>Our hope is to help each developer find their own answer to the never ending question: Is there a core skill set that can enable me to efficiently create elegant solutions that have the desired reach.</span></p>

          <li><span>Meet and greet</span></li>
          <li><span>A couple 'lightning talks' (5 mins) on topics such as 'Quick Tips', 'Hot Modules', 'Node.JS Core Update', etc.</span></li>
          <li><span>One or two longer talks (20 mins) on topics such as 'How To .....', 'Module Review', 'Case Study', 'Project Pitch', etc. I'd like to encourage these longer talks to include 'live coding' and actual execution of sample code. In my experience, showing people how stuff really works is both more engaging and more impressive :)</span></li>
          <li><span>Keep the conversation going over drinks and snacks.</span></li>

Considering the pace of evolution in the JavaScript world, trying to stay on top of all that's happening is at best optimistic, and at worst a fool's game. But don't surrender! Enjoy the support and encouragement of a community of like-minded JavaScript coders and enthusiasts. We agree on what we most want to read, commit to a timeframe, and then get together to discuss what we've learned. Together we are building an environment where we can exchange informed opinions and insights with peers, while reading a curated selection of expert writings about JavaScript and its various flavors, libraries, and implementations.</p>"

        description: "<p>Welcome to the <strong>Toronto AngularJS</strong> meetup. We generally try to meet the 3rd Wednesday of every month. Join our group and follow us\_<span>on twitter for updates,</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NGToronto\">@NGToronto</a>.</p>\n<p><span>AngularJS is the future of web development. It's so much better than everything else you'll shed tears of joy as you finally shed the trauma of out-of-control unobtrusive JavaScript (how on earth do you figure out what a page does?), jQuery (amazing but it doesn't scale), overloaded CSS (update at your own risk!) and the resulting expensive and unmaintainable web applications. AngularJS is to jQuery what jQuery is to non-library JavaScript. It's that good.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The 5 D's of AngularJS:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>DRY</strong>. Don't repeat yourself, which means no boilerplate.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Declarative</strong>. HTML is the template and markup with AngularJS directives is the templating language. This works perfectly thanks to the next two D's.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Dependency injection</strong>. Now I'm crying. You can actually test AngularJS apps, but more importantly you have scoping kung-fu where everything is modular, decoupled, and has a clearly logical place to go. It's pretty, implicit, magical, and it fixes 90% of what's wrong with every other JavaScript framework.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Data-binding</strong>. Now I'm openly weeping with joy. Data-binding in a dependency managed, magically scoped, declarative, and DRY language is beautiful, amazingly succinct and powerful. Data-binding isn't the start with Angular- it's result. And this is the essence of Angular- the magic is in how everything works together. Dry + Declarative + Dependency Injection + Data-binding ALL work together. Remove one of them and AngularJS isn't AngularJS.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Designer-Friendly</strong>. Your CSS will no longer look like you wrote it while on crack, and you can see within the HTML the general outline of what those developers are doing. And with that, you are free to go to town on the markup so long as you don't delete the ng- magic tags. Yes, dear designer, you can change the markup and style the application without destroying the business logic. How cool is that.</p>\n<p>So there you have it.</p>\n<p>Tweet insights to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NGToronto\">@NGToronto</a> using the <strong>#AngularJSTO</strong> hashtag.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESENTING:</strong></p>\n<p>We are always looking for speakers &amp; presenters for future meetups, so if you are using or teaching AngularJS, please submit to speak:</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Speaker\">http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Speaker</a></span></p>\n<p>If you wish to recommend someone to speak or a topic you want covered, please submit to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Recommend\">http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Recommend</a></p>\n<p>if you have an interest in sharing your work with the group.</p>\n<p><em>Watch these and other AngularJS-Toronto meetup talks at\_<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/rangleio/\">youtube.com/rangleio</a></em></p>"

        description: |-
          <p>Often considered as not so serious in the recent past, Javascript has come a long way in becoming the most popular language used on all size projects. A handful of libraries such as jQuery brought it to the masses and unveiled the true potential of JS resulting in a widespread adoption of it. As you may find out it is very easy to get started with Javascript, almost instantly you can see your code being executed in the browser window and strike a superhero pose thinking out loud "I rock!!!." In reality as easy it is to write JS code it's even easier to write bad code or over engineered chunks to do simple or complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br>This meetup is geared toward the beginner in programing in general with a focus on Javascript. We will take the baby steps to learn the core language first and slowly but surely look at libraries and frameworks. <br>If you are a print or web designer who has never coded before but want to add a new skill to your toolbox, a hobbyist who is enthusiastic about new languages and technologies in general, or want to unlock the true potential of HTML5 with the new APIs such as geolocation, File, websockets and more, this is definitely the meetup for you.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br>This will be run workshop style with a lot of hands on training and a small amount of lectures and presentations. So come and get ready to get your hands dirty.</p>

Our favourite hangout spots are tech companies in the area - we've been to Google, Mozilla, MongoDB, ShareThis, Nook, Elastic, Shape and more so far.</p>
          <p>This is a meetup for newbies and advanced users alike. If you're looking to learn about Meteor, we'll be there to help you out! Just come to a hands on working session, generally organised by Laurie, and get to know other early Meteor developers. If you've built something with Meteor and you'd like to share, let us know and we can schedule a lightning talk for you at the next meetup!</p>

We'd like to make the discussions community driven so please suggest topics, but there will definitely be talks on architectures, testing strategies, code management, development tools, deployment strategies, the future of Node and emerging trends. See you there!"

          <p>Utah web developers exploring different areas of Node.js such as making RESTful APIs and exploring popular libraries and frameworks.</p>
          <p><span>NodeJS is emerging as a powerful platform for building Internet applications. As an emergent technology, NodeJS does not yet have the ensemble of tools and infrastructural parts that mature language systems have. The NodeJS community is relatively small, and we all need to learn from each other's efforts to work with it. The Utah Node.js Ninjas exist to foster interaction among NodeJS developers. The goals for this group are to build our local NodeJS developer community, encourage adoption of NodeJS by businesses in the area, and help people better understand and use NodeJS in applications, both for personal and business uses.</span></p>
          <p><span>We have weekly meetings, alternating between presentations and hack nights. Hack nights also double as a beginners course, partnering with Nodeschool.io. Anyone interested in learning Node from the ground up is welcome to attend and learn with us!</span></p>

Each project has time to:<br>\n\n - Present what you group did last week.<br>\n\n - Talk about design choices, options chosen and other ideas from the group.<br>\n\n - Discuss next weeks tasks and ask for group feedback.</p>\n<p>(II.) Layer in appropriate tutorials for the group:<br>\n\n - The emphasis is on \"full-stack\" development, so these will be tutorials emphasizing \"Using Rails with AngularJS.\" etc.<br>\n\n - We select a book, assign homework as a group, and discuss at the Meetup.</p>\n<p>(III.) A short weekly \"How To\" presentation:<br>\n\n - A \"How To\" presentation covering Rails fundamentals.<br>\n\n \_\_\_\_\_\_ For example: How to use \"rake routes.\"</p>\n<p><br>\n\n <b>Note on Experience Level</b>:<br>\n\n We are open to all developers -- please come join us! However, this group is intended as a intermediate (and up) group.\_ If you are a beginner, please feel free to join us, but we also have a \"Beginners Rails\" group that meets on Thursdays where we start from HTML &amp; CSS and work our way through tutorials such as Hartl's Rails Tutorial: (<a href=\"https://www.railstutorial.org\">https://www.railstutorial.org</a>).</p>\n<p>Our Beginners Rails Study Group: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/LA-Eastside-Ruby-Rails-Study-Group\">http://www.meetup.com/LA-Eastside-Ruby-Rails-Study-Group</a></p>\n<p>Please feel free to come to both!</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>If you've already done tutorials such as <b><i>Hartl's Rails Tutorial</i></b> or gone to one the \"<i><b>BootCamps</b></i>\" such as General Assembly, this is a <b>great group to maintain your skills</b>, keep you up-to-date with software industry best practices, and explore fresh technologies as they emerge.</p>\n<p><i><b>JavaScript in the Front, WebApp Framework in the Back:</b></i><br>\n\n Though we tend to have our conversations around a Rails/Angular implementations, we encourage participation of WebApp developer using any modern full application stacks. We can all learn from each other and are interested in learning from developers using any of the following:</p>\n<p><b>Web Application Frameworks</b>:<br>\n\n Rails4<br>\n\n Django<br>\n\n Drupal<br>\n\n Symfony2<br>\n\nFlask</p>\n<p><b>JavaScript Technologies</b>:<br>\n\n Angular<br>\n\n Backbone<br>\n\n Ember<br>\n\n JQuery<br>\n\nReact</p>\n<p>MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)</p>\n<p>AND many more...</p>\n<p>Most of the discussion will be around Rails, but any and all are welcome.</p>\n<p>We also use this group as an opportunity to stay up on trends.\_ Not all trends are worth pursuing, but many are worthy of discussion.\_ For example, these days, \"decoupled WebApps,\" is the new thing.\_ As interested developers, the group will be exploring decoupled design pattern, to see how this architecture pattern may fit within our projects.</p>\n<p>*This group is meant for developers.\_ Beginners through professionals are welcome, but please come prepared to learn.\_ We love participation!</p>\n<p>**The is not a place to pitch your business ideas, nor for recruitment.</p>"

          <p>Welcome to the <b>Toronto</b> meetup group for <b>elasticsearch</b>!</p>
          <p>I have recently moved from Amsterdam to Toronto. In Amsterdam I worked for the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, the national audiovisual archive of the Netherlands and one of the largest archives in Europe. The institute was one of the early adopters of elasticsearch, using it to power the archive's search engine: <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/case-study/sound-and-vision" target="_blank" class="linkified">http://www.elasticsearch.org/case-study/sound-and-vision</a> (if you have a Dutch background or if you are into Dutch cultural heritage, you might enjoy this site: <a href="http://in.beeldengeluid.nl" target="_blank" class="linkified">http://in.beeldengeluid.nl</a>).<br>

          </p>
          <p>I have already moved on to another project, but since I could not find an elasticsearch meetup group here in Toronto, I thought that I should start one. I'm happy to share my experience with mappings, settings and bringing an elasticsearch cluster to production, and then let the community take it forward. You all use elasticsearch, don't you?<br>

          <p>westvalleywebdev</p>
          <p>The West Valley OSS Web Development Meetup group is a friendly learning-based meetup for people new to open-source web development. This meetup is ideal for high school (with parents in tow...members must be 18 but parents can join for their kids) and college students, Jr. developers, and people new to web development (career change, etc.). The goal of the meetup is to help foster the growth of professional web developers here in the West Valley. We welcome people of all skill levels but topics will be most beneficial to beginning and intermediate developers. More seasoned developers are certainly welcome to join as long as you are interested in guiding and helping other members who want to learn.</p>
          <p>This meetup is a collaborative effort and thus members are expected to not only be interested in learning all aspects of web development but also willing to help their fellow developers when needed. Each meetup will have a speaker who will give a short 30-45min presentation followed by 30-60min of an open lab where members can work on the topics covered or just seek help and guidance on their own projects from other members. This group is about learning and problem solving as much as it is about making professional connections.</p>
          <p>Because we are an OSS focused group, we will primarily cover OSS-related topics like popular web languages (JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.), databases (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.), Linux as a server, code management (Git/Mercurial, DVCS, etc.), APIs and cloud services (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.), and a variety of other related topics! Ideas and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
          <p>Meetups will be graciously hosted by the awesome START center at West-MEC (<a href="http://west-mec.org/start/" class="linkified">http://west-mec.org/start/</a>).</p>
          <p>Check out our slack (<a href="https://slack.com/">https://slack.com/</a>) team at "westvalleywebdev" Instructions for joining are <a href="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201405046-Joining-multiple-Slack-teams">here</a>. Ask development questions, connect with others, and make group-related announcements. Please no spam!</p>

          <p> <br><a href="http://sailsjs.org">Sails.js</a> is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat. <br></p>
          <p><a href="https://treeline.io/">Treeline.io</a> allows you to build the back end of a web or mobile application by combining components (aka “<a href="http://node-machine.org/">node-machines</a>”) in a visual environment. Your app is then compiled into a Sails.js project that can be downloaded and deployed anywhere. In short, Treeline eliminates the need for specialized knowledge to create back-end apps.</p>
          <p>Collaborative Coding provides the opportunity for coders to work on their own projects while sharing the company of other coders working with the same language or framework. Lets share tips, code, and experience with each other.</p>

        description: |-
          <p>Tired of always being the only chick at tech meetups? Tired of for-profit girl-only meetups that cite feminist empowerment as a motivation to program? We started a hack for the ladies who want to keep it real. We don't want to hear about the glass ceiling. We don't want to be asked if our dad/brother/boyfriend got us into programming. We just want to get our hack on. GirlHack is every Thursday. Bring your latest project, bring a friend, bring your A-Game.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We have 1weeks and 0weeks. 0weeks are are informal hacks: opportunities to pair, get feedback, or get help. 1weeks are hacks with a purpose, where we will be tackling specific topics, or hosting speakers. Occasionally, we'll host hikes, beach days, or even go rock climbing. And, tech conferences? Ooooh girl. Good times will be had by all. Location independent: We'll host in or around West LA / Santa Monica, until we find an optimal central location for our major patrons. (There's an algorithm for that!)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We prefer to keep it open source. Our talks will probably never encompass Microsoft or Oracle technologies, due to cost (just like our meetups, we like our software FREE). Unix based operating systems are assumed (Linux, Mac, BSD). Let us know if you are a Windows user, hoping to come to the dark side. We have distros of Mint or Ubuntu waiting! UEFI notwithstanding. We're interested in: anything .js, ruby, php, python, functional, or c-based. We'll focus on: algorithms, version control, agile, TDD and BDD, workflow, frameworks, security, cryptography, maths, scientific programming, best practices, and more.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It's all free, unless there are entry or venue fees. We want to keep this as free as possible. Girlhack has only one request: don't be a dick, and don't have one.</p>

          <p>Open Source NH is a networking and learning resource for open source software developers in NH. This group is Programming Language, licence, OS, and text editor agnostic. Meaning the "what" is more important than the "how" in regards to joining the group. That is to say the group is generally open to those who develop code they release to the public. The group is also open to those who are new to programming and looking opportunities to learn.</p>
          <p>Our Meetings are normally either social (find help, get help) or hands on (workshop or group project) maybe a mix of both.</p>
          <p>The regular "Find help, get help" meeting format is a bit different but simple. Members suggest issues they are dealing with or impending interest on the meet-up event page. Depending on what is appropriate, the meeting may break out into separate groups for individual topics or just have a full group discussion. The main goal is having the opportunity to get new perspective, with the recognition that solutions or complete understanding may still be hard to come by. As a default in the absence of topics or being involved in one, the meeting is social/networking. Workshops or group projects may come about based on member interest.</p>

          <p>This is a group for people interested in <b>high quality code</b>... doesn't really matter what language, what methodology, or what kind of environment you work in (big enterprise, startup, open source, etc.). All that matters is that you're interested in getting together now and then (in real life or virtually) to talk about great code and what makes it great.</p>
          <p>BTW, I know there's a "thing" around software craftsmanship (not to mention a conference coming to LA in 2015) and we should talk about that movement. But the time we spend together in these Meetups should be much broader, focused only on high quality code and not centered around any manifestos.</p>
          <p>Long term, the goal is to give members the tools (and inspire them) to write amazing code&nbsp;accomplish by learning from others, study, mentorship, hands on experience, and open discussion.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Welcome! The reason people who only watch programming videos don't become programmers is because they're not programming. Come join other aspiring engineers and start building! In JavaScript the Hard Parts, we cover callbacks, higher-order functions (functional programming with JavaScript), object-oriented programming with JavaScript, closure, scope and execution context.</p>
          <p><span>&nbsp;JavaScript the Hard Parts has been our most popular workshop in LA, and now Codesmith CEO Will Sentance is bringing it to San Francisco.&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p><span>Price: Always free&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p><span>About Codesmith: Codesmith teaches full stack software engineering in JavaScript through a 12 week immersive program. We teach computer science, object-oriented JavaScript, React, Angular, Node, distributed systems and mobile development so our grads can secure mid-to-senior level software engineering positions or launch their own ventures&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p>Calling ALL coders! &nbsp;This Meetup group is for <b>designers and developers</b> who share the same kind of passion for coding that I do no matter your skill level or programming background. I have been to Meetups before that center around programming, but I haven't found one that really pushes it's members to really create something throughout the course of the meetings. That is something I hope to change with this group.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>LETS CREATE SOMETHING!</p>
          <p>The purpose of this Meetup is to test out a new style of gathering where <b>everyone binds their skills with coding and design together</b> to create something... &nbsp;Who know's what that something will end up being, but we will create SOMETHING! Currently, there is no direction that is chiseled in stone, but the Idea is that whoever comes can contribute a component to a project using whatever language he/she is comfortable with even if it requires a little bit of learning. C++,&nbsp;.NET, AngularJS, BackboneJS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, SQL, MONGO, Python, etc... Your language is your choice. The challenge is to figure out how to create something <b>larger than ourselves</b> that <b>anyone</b> new<b> (from beginners to professionals) can contribute</b> to <b>or</b> can learn the language that he/she is interested in and&nbsp;<b>learn how to contribute</b>. The great thing is that I think the power of project management with git can make this work. I am hoping for great things with this group.</p>
          <p>At the very least, we will get to know and learn from fellow coders around the Nash county area. As far as a place to meet, details will be released once we get a few members interested.</p>

          <p>This is a meetup dedicated to having coders helping coders. Each meetup will consist of more doing and less anything else. Bring your laptop, and be ready to ask questions (bugs, coding style, concepts, getting setup) or be ready to help. We'll meet at a common venue, and people will pair up or group up to help each other whatever is necessary. Feel free to buy whoever is helping you a beer or a muffin, but not necessary. Open to programmers of all skill sets, absolute beginners to pros.</p>
          <p>No Recruiters or Recruiting allowed. You must have the desire to help others coding or to learn how to code.</p>
          <p>We will be vetting people to make sure everyone has a quality time with this meetup!</p>

          <p>This a small meet-up I am currently running out of my house. The point is to get career developers together in an intimate setting and discuss some of the things that we do literally every day. I'll try to include at least one presentation on technology at each group meeting, but then it is free-form discussion and coding. I'll have coffee and beer if you want it. <br> <br>I have to limit this to 10 - 15 spots at first. Please attend only if you are on the RSVP list. I know a lot of people don't show up, but if you really want to come by and hang with your fellow abused coders just message me personally.</p>
          <p>This is not a group for recruiters or 'idea guys' trying to sell their ideas. This group is for people who have already made a commitment to coding whether that is personal or professional. This is a group for people who have figured out how to get the job done, whatever that means.</p>
          <p>I am very laid back and casual and you are all welcome to come talk about your problems, personal and professional. We'll sort out the mess of tools and languages we're expected to know as well as the pressures that modern life puts on a person who is expected to literally know everything and never stop working.</p>
          <p>If we share and help each other with our unique situation we can make our lives a little bit easier.</p>
          <p>I can't wait to meet you!</p>

What it's trying to say is that if you want to develop advanced front-ends without creating a spaghetti monster with fifty configuration options for factories, directives, providers, routers, and dozens of other configured objects, Aurelia might be more suited to your needs. Come and join us to find out if it does meet you needs, as we're a group of non-zealots who are open to any and all practical, useful, real-world applicable technologies. Oh, and we promise not to demonstrate To-do apps, Twitter clients, or weather displaying widgets."

          We've got Daniel Khan, Klaus Enzenhofer, and Harald Zeitlhofer visiting for just one night, so we thought it would be a grand idea to hold a massive meetup for them.

          All three are experts in their respective fields, and they are all highly experienced conference presenters - so this promises to be an evening of Node.js, PHP, and Mobile Cloud learning from some great speakers.

          This is a free event, with food and drink provided, but we need you to register as numbers are limited by the venue size.
