# Diagnostics Guide

These guides were created in the [Diagnostics Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics)
with the objective to provide a guidance when diagnosing an issue
in the user application.
The documentation project is organized based on user journey.
Those journeys are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures,
that a user follows for problem determination of reported issues.

This is the available set of diagnostics guides:
