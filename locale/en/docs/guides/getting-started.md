# Getting Started

First we have to make sure that Node.js is correctly installed in you 
system.
Then we will run a small JavaScript code using node.

**Test node:** To check if Node is installed properly in you system,
open the terminal or command prompt and run command 
<code>node -v </code>. This should print the version, so it will 
show you something like this <code>v4.5.0</code>.

```javascript
c:\node> node -v
v4.5.0
```

**Create a test file and run it:** This is the easiest way to check Node.js
in your system. Create a simple JavaScript file and run it with node.
Create JavaScript file and name it <code>test.js</code> and just add simple 
JavaScript code in the file. <code> console.log("Hey! Node is working properly.")</code>

To run this code simply open the terminal or command prompt. Navigate to
the folder where you created the <code>test.js</code> file.

And run the command <code>node test.js</code>. You will see the output on the terminal.
<code>Hey! Node is working properly</code> 

```javascript
c:\node> node test.js
Hey! Node is working properly.
```

If you can see the output then Node is working properly in your system.
