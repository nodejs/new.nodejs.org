# FAQ

## How can I contribute?

Everyone can help. Node.js adheres to a [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct), and contributions, releases, and contributorship are under an [open governance](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#readme) model.

To get started, there are open [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues), and we'd love to hear your feedback. Becoming involved in discussions is a good way to get a feel of where you can help out further. If there is something there you feel you can tackle, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions).

## Where do discussions take place?

There is an #node.js channel on Freenode IRC. We keep logs of the channel [here](http://logs.libuv.org/node.js/latest).

## What is open source governance?

Open source governance advocates the application of the philosophies of the open source and open content movements in order to enable any interested party to add to the creation of the end product, as with a wiki document. Legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their collective wisdom to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.
