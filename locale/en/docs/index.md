# About Docs

It's important for Node.js to provide documentation to its users, but documentation means different things to different people. Here on nodejs.org, you will find three types of documentation: API reference documentation, ES6 features, and frequently asked questions.

### API Reference Documentation

Our [API reference documentation](/api/) is meant to provide detailed version information about a given method or pattern in Node.js. From this documentation you should be able to identify what input a method has, the return value of that method, and what, if any, errors may be related to that method. You should also be able to identify which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.

        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/">Node.js 0.12.x</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.10.x/api/">Node.js 0.10.x</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/">all versions</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

### ES6 Features

The [ES6 section](/en/docs/es6/) describes the three ES6 feature groups, and details which features are enabled by default in Node.js, alongside explanatory links. It also shows how to find which version of V8 shipped with a particular Node.js release.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Our [FAQ](/en/docs/faq/) covers how everyone can contribute to Node.js, our code of conduct and governance model, how to get in touch on github and IRC, and how to help out with triaging issues.

This documentation is meant only to describe the builtin core modules provided by Node.js, and does not cover any particular module or collection of modules found in the community.
