# Certification Programs for Node.js Developers

The OpenJS Foundation is committed to growing our community of hosted projects. We believe it is important to foster a broad range of skills within the contributor and implementer communities, enabling continued and sustained adoption of JavaScript and related technologies.

Certification is a key step in that process, allowing certified developers to quickly establish their credibility and value in the job market, and also allowing companies to locate and hire high-quality teams to support their growth.

The [OpenJS Node.js Services Developer (JSNSD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnsd/) and [OpenJS Node.js Application Developer (JSNAD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnad/) certifications are available now. Proceeds from the exam registration fees support the OpenJS Foundation, which in turn support [hosted projects](https://openjsf.org/projects).
