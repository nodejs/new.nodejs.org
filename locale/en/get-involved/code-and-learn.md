## Code + Learn

Code + Learn is a worldwide initiative of workshop sprints to introduce new developers to working on Node.js.  Supportive, hands-on sessions are mentored by existing contributors and tackle real problems.

Kicking off in September 2015, sprints have already taken place in Dublin and London (led by [LNUG](http://lnug.org/)).
