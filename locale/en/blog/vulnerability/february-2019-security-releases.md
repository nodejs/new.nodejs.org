## Summary

The Node.js project will release new versions of all supported release lines on, or shortly after, Wednesday, February 27th, 2019 UTC. These releases will incorporate at least two security fixes specific to Node.js, the highest severity of which is 'low'.

The OpenSSL project has announced [releases](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2019-February/000145.html) for the 26th which may impact some release lines of Node.js and require inclusion in our security releases. The highest severity indicated by OpenSSL is ['moderate'](https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html#moderate) and impacts OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is used by Node.js 6.x and 8.x. A bug-fix release for OpenSSL 1.1.1 will also be made available and we will assess the impact, if any, on Node.js 11.x which uses this version. Node.js 10.x will not be impacted by the OpenSSL releases.
