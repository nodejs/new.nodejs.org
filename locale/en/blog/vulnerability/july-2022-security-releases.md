## Release timing

Releases will be available on, or shortly after, Tuesday, July 5th, 2022.

However, when details of the OpenSSL defects are released on the 5th, our team will be making a more detailed assessment
on the likely severity for Node.js users.

The OpenSSL release may delay the Node.js release date. See [OpenSSL Security Release](#update-04-07-2022-openssl-security-release)

Please monitor the **nodejs-sec** Google Group for updates, including a decision within 24 hours after the OpenSSL release regarding release timing, and full details of the defects upon eventual release: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec
