# Summary

The Node.js project will release new versions of the 14.x, 16.x, and 18.x
releases lines on or shortly after Tuesday, July 5th, 2022 in order to address:

* Three medium severity issues.
* Two high severity issues.

## Impact

The 18.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to three medium severity issues and one high severity issues.

The 16.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to three medium severity issues and two high severity issues.

The 14.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to three medium severity issues and two high severity issues.

## Release timing

Releases will be available on, or shortly after, Tuesday, July 5th, 2022.

However, when details of the OpenSSL defects are released on the 5th, our team will be making a more detailed assessment
on the likely severity for Node.js users.

The OpenSSL release may delay the Node.js release date. See [OpenSSL Security Release](#update-04-07-2022-openssl-security-release)

Please monitor the **nodejs-sec** Google Group for updates, including a decision within 24 hours after the OpenSSL release regarding release timing, and full details of the defects upon eventual release: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec

## Contact and future updates

The current Node.js security policy can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/security/. Please follow the process outlined in https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/SECURITY.md if you wish to report a vulnerability in Node.js.

Subscribe to the low-volume announcement-only nodejs-sec mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec to stay up to date on security vulnerabilities and security-related releases of Node.js and the projects maintained in the nodejs GitHub organization.

## (Update 04-Jul-2022) OpenSSL Security Release

The OpenSSL versions 1.1.1q and 3.0.5 will be released July, 5th 2022. The announcement can be found here: https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-July/000229.html

The Node.js team will evaluate the OpenSSL changes when they are available and then announce the new target date by Thursday or earlier.

## (Update 05-Jul-2022) OpenSSL Security Release Assessement

With respect to the vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL Security releases of Jul 5th 2022 affects Node.js v18.x, v16.x, and v14.x.

* Node.js is affected by **one** MODERATE vulnerability on Windows 32-Bit x86.

The security release will be delayed so that we can incorporate the the updated OpenSSL versions.  We
will post another update once we have an updated target for the release date.

### Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-July/000232.html) is:

#### Heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation (CVE-2022-2274) (HIGH)

This vulnerability affects OpenSSL 3.0.4 users. However, Node.js has not shipped any version that used OpenSSL 3.0.4.
Therefore, Node.js is not affected.

#### AES OCB fails to encrypt some bytes (CVE-2022-2097) (MODERATE)

This vulnerability affects Windows 32-Bit x86 users using `AES OCB` encryption. The serverity is MODERATE.
