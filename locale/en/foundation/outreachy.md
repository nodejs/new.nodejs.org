### Outreachy

**Welcome to Node.js + Outreachy**  
Outreachy provides a collaborative environment in which newcomers from underrepresented backgrounds can get help working on their first contributions and a focused opportunity for them to dedicate a full-time effort to learning and contributing to FOSS. The program also assists people with finding mentors to help them with their projects. By participating in the program, interns develop a good understanding of the power of FOSS and skills necessary to continue contributing to it.  

The Node.js project is excited to partner with Outreachy to invite newcomers with diverse perspectives into our community for the December 2016 cohort.  

Participation is open internationally to all women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Additionally, it's open to residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. We are planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.

**What is Node.js?**  
From our guiding principles, "The goal of the Node.js project is to provide a JavaScript-based application development platform that is current, reliable, and stable.  

Contributors to Node.js work on behalf of the community of users who build their applications and businesses with the Node.js platform. Accordingly, contributors must demonstrate an ongoing commitment, not only to the Project, but to the stability and vitality of the community as a whole...  

The Node.js community is large, inclusive, and excited to enable as many users to contribute in whatever way they can. If you want to report an issue, help with documentation or contribute to the code base of the project, you’ve come to the right place."  

**PARTICIPANTS**

How can I familiarize myself with the community and project?

- We’re on IRC! Connect to irc.freenode.net in the #node.js channel with an IRC client or connect in your web browser to the channel using [freenode's WebChat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=node.js).

- The [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues) is the place for discussion of Node.js core features.
- Read more about our   [contributing](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [collaborator](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md) guidelines  
- Check out some of our [international communities](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/)  
- Introduce yourself to the project's mentors and discuss what your tasks during the internship program would be.

**How to apply and application tips**

The application process is described in detail at https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#Send_in_an_Application. A contribution is required and you answer questions when you apply. You are expected to work full-time on the internship although you can indicate any pre-planned time off in your application.  

In order to make your application stronger, here are a few things you could consider including:

- Previously worked projects/coding experience. If it is docs, related experience if any
- What do you intend to learn from the selected project? Or rationale behind choosing the specific project
- How do you think this internship is going to help you achieve what you wanted?
- Your next choice of projects if your first choice is not available

Also include information or link on your merged patch (which is a requirement to be considered for the internship). Please be available and responsive throughout the application period so we can work with you on improving your application.

**Questions about the Node.js project?**

With open source, just finding out where to ask your question can be intimidating. Email [Tracy Hinds](tracyhinds@linuxfoundation.org) if you have any questions during the application process and she’ll be happy to find the person most helpful, if she isn’t it.

**PROJECTS**
**Improve the vm module in Node.js core**  
*Mentor:* [Franziska Hinkelmann](https://plus.google.com/u/1/116713283748910059509?prsrc=4)    
The vm module is used in the Node.js command line and in DOM implementations, such as jsdom. Sadly, there are many open issues related to the module and it needs some love. Recent changes in V8, Node's JS engine, now make it possible to fix several of the issues and improve the vm code base significantly.    

This project includes learning how to build and debug Node.js core, how the vm module is implemented, some Node internals about the global proxy, and how to use the V8 API. You will be coding in C++ and write tests in JavaScript. No worries if you're not too familiar with these languages, a desire to learn and curiosity are much more important than a fixed skill set.

Mentor based in Europe.
