# Governan√ßa do Projeto

## Processo de Busca por Consenso

The Node.js project follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model.

## Collaborators

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators
and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the
TSC and their nomination is discussed with the existing Collaborators.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project's [README.md][].

A guide for Collaborators is maintained at [collaborator-guide.md][].

## Technical Steering Committee

The project is governed by the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)][]
which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.
