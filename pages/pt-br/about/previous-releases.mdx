# Versões anteriores

Major Node.js versions enter _Current_ release status for six months, which gives library authors time to add support for them.
After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported, and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to _Active LTS_ status and are ready for general use.
_LTS_ release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months.
Production applications should only use _Active LTS_ or _Maintenance LTS_ releases.
