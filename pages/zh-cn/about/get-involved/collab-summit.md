# 协作者峰会

Node.js协作者峰会是一个非正式的会议，其目的在于让现有的及具潜力的协作者齐聚一堂，让大家以现场协作、教学及分享知识的方式一同讨论Node.js。委员会及工作组每年有两次聚会，他们会一起做出重要的决定，同时还会在线下开展他们想要推进的令人兴奋的工作。

## 谁参加？

Anyone is welcome to attend Collab Summit. During the
summit, leaders will help onboard new contributors to groups they'd love to help
prior to integrating them into the working sessions.

This is your opportunity to learn what is happening within the community to jump
in and contribute with the skills you have and would like to hone.

Working groups will put together a schedule so that people can
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

We'd love to see you at Collab Summit! Check out the [Summit repo](https://github.com/nodejs/summit)
for upcoming and past Collab Summits and have a look at the
[issues filed](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues) that share what
individual working groups and committees are looking to discuss in-person.
