# User Journey

These diagnostics guides were created by the [Diagnostics Working Group][] with the
objective of providing guidance when diagnosing an issue in a user's
application.

The documentation project is organized based on user journey. Those journeys
are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures that a user can follow to
root-cause their issues.

This is the available set of diagnostics guides:

- [Memory](/learn/diagnostics/memory)
- [Live Debugging](/learn/diagnostics/live-debugging)
- [Poor Performance](/learn/diagnostics/poor-performance)
