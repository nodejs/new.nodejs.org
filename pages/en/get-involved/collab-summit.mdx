# Collab Summit

Collaboration Summit is an un-conference for bringing current and
potential contributors together to discuss Node.js with lively collaboration,
education, and knowledge sharing. Committees and working groups come together
twice per year to make important decisions while also being able to work on some
exciting efforts they want to push forward in-person.

## Who attends?

Anyone is welcome to attend Collab Summit. During the
summit, leaders will help onboard new contributors to groups they'd love to help
prior to integrating them into the working sessions.

This is your opportunity to learn what is happening within the community to jump
in and contribute with the skills you have and would like to hone.

Working groups will put together a schedule so that people can
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

We'd love to see you at Collab Summit! Check out the [Summit repo](https://github.com/nodejs/summit)
for upcoming and past Collab Summits and have a look at the
[issues filed](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues) that share what
individual working groups and committees are looking to discuss in-person.
